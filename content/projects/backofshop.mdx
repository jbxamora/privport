# backofshop
This is a back end for an e-commerce website built with the latest technologies, allowing the company to compete with other e-commerce companies. The application uses Express.js API, Sequelize, and MySQL2 to connect to a database and retrieve data for categories, products, and tags. The project includes schema and seed commands to create and populate a development database with test data.

## Installation

To install and run on your local machine, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Install the necessary dependencies

`npm init`

`npm install mysql2`

`npm install sequelize`

`npm install dotenv`

Run the Application

`mysql -u root -p`

Enter PW when promted

`source db/schema.sql`

`quit`

`npm run seed`
  
`npm start`


## Code Snippets

### GET ROUTE for Tags
This route is using the Express Router to define a `GET` route that retrieves a single tag by its `ID`, and includes associated products. It first calls the Sequelize `findOne()` method with the `ID` parameter from the request. It then includes the associated model `Product` and specifies which attributes to retrieve for it. The retrieved data is returned in JSON format using `res.json()`. If an error occurs, it logs the error to the console and returns a 500 status code with the error in JSON format using `res.status(500).json()`.

```js
router.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
  Tag.findOne({
    where: {
      id: req.params.id
    },
    include: {
      model: Product,
      attributes: ['product_name', 'price', 'stock', 'category_id']
    }
  })
    .then(dbTagData => res.json(dbTagData))
    .catch(err => {
      console.log(err);
      res.status(500).json(err);
    });
});

```

### DELETE Route For Category
This is a route in an Express.js API that handles a `DELETE` request for a category resource. When a client makes a `DELETE` request to the specified endpoint, the server will attempt to delete a category with the ID specified in the request parameters.

First, the Category model's `destroy()` method is called with an object that specifies the ID of the category to be deleted. If the deletion is successful, the response will be a JSON object containing information about the deleted category.

If there is no category with the specified ID, the server will respond with a 404 status code and a JSON object containing an error message. If there is a server error during the deletion process, the server will respond with a 500 status code and a JSON object containing the error message.

```js
router.delete('/:id', (req, res) => {
  // delete a category by its `id` value
  Category.destroy({
    where: {
      id: req.params.id
    }
  })
    .then(dbCategoryData => {
      if (!dbCategoryData) {
        res.status(404).json({ message: 'No category found with this id' });
        return;
      }
      res.json(dbCategoryData);
    })
    .catch(err => {
      console.log(err);
      res.status(500).json(err);
    });
});
```
