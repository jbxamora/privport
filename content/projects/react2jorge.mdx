# React Portfolio

Built using React.js + Three.js


This is a portfolio I built from scratch meant to showcase skills, projects, work experience and my tech stack/ capabilities.

## Code Snippets

The code snippet is defining a React functional component called `BallCanvas`, which is responsible for rendering a 3D sphere with a texture image mapped onto it. The component is using the `Canvas` component from the `@react-three/fiber` library to create a WebGL canvas.

The `frameloop` property of the `Canvas` component is set to `"demand"`, which means the canvas will only update when needed, resulting in better performance. The `dpr` property is set to `[1, 2]`, which defines the device pixel ratio, ensuring that the canvas looks sharp on high-resolution screens. The `gl` property is set to `{ preserveDrawingBuffer: true }`, which enables the canvas to be saved as an image.

The component is using the `Suspense` component from React to provide a fallback component while the 3D model and texture are being loaded. Inside the `Suspense` component, the `OrbitControls` component from the `@react-three/drei` library is used to allow for rotating the 3D sphere. Finally, the `Ball` component is rendered with the `imgUrl` prop set to the `icon` value, which is the URL of the texture image.

The `Preload` component from `@react-three/drei` is used to preload all assets, which can improve performance by reducing load times.

```js
// Define a BallCanvas component that renders a Canvas from @react-three/fiber
const BallCanvas = ({ icon }) => {
  return (
    <Canvas
      frameloop="demand"
      dpr={[1, 2]}
      gl={{ preserveDrawingBuffer: true }}
    >
      <Suspense fallback={<CanvasLoader />}>
        {/* Add OrbitControls to allow for rotating the Ball */}
        <OrbitControls enableZoom={false} />
        {/* Render the Ball component, passing the icon prop as the texture URL */}
        <Ball imgUrl={icon} />
      </Suspense>

      {/* Use Preload from drei to preload all assets */}
      <Preload all />
    </Canvas>
  );
};
```
Then

```js
const Tech = () => {
  // Returning a flex container with each technology rendered as a BallCanvas component
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-row flex-wrap justify-center gap-10">
      {technologies.map((technology) => (
        <div className="w-28 h-28" key={technology.name}>
          <BallCanvas icon={technology.icon} />
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Earth
The `EarthCanvas` component renders a 3D model of Earth using Three.js and the `useGLTF` hook from `@react-three/drei`. The `Canvas` element provides the Three.js rendering context and camera, and the `OrbitControls` component enables interactive camera controls. The `Earth` component loads the 3D model using the `useGLTF` hook and renders it using the `primitive` component.
```js
const Earth = () => {
  const earth = useGLTF('./planet/scene.gltf');
  return (
    <primitive 
    object={earth.scene}
    scale={2.5}
    position-y={0}
    position-x={0}/>
  )
}

const EarthCanvas = () => {
  return (
    <Canvas
    shadows
    frameloop='demand'
    gl={{ preserveDrawingBuffer: true }}
    camera={{
      fov: 45,
      near: 0.1,
      far: 200,
      position: [-4, 3, 6],
     }}
    >
      <Suspense fallback={<CanvasLoader />}>
        <OrbitControls 
        autoRotate
        enableZoom={false}
        maxPolarAngle={Math.PI / 2}
        minPolarAngle={Math.PI / 2} />
        <Earth />
        </Suspense>
    </Canvas>
  )
}

```
