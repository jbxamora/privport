## Code Snippets

### Update Employee Managers
This function updates an employee's manager by first querying the employee and manager lists, prompting the user to select which employee's manager to update and their new manager, and then creating a temporary table to hold the employee IDs and full names before updating the employee's manager ID with the selected manager's ID. Once the update is complete, the temporary table is dropped and the user is returned to the main menu.
```js
function updateEmployeeManager() {
  // Query employees to get a list of available employees
  connection.query(
    `SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS employee FROM employee`,
    function (err, res) {
      if (err) throw err;

      // Map the employee names to an array of employee choices
      const employees = res.map((employee) => employee.employee);

      // Query employees to get a list of available managers
      connection.query(
        `SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS manager FROM employee`,
        function (err, res) {
          if (err) throw err;

          // Map the manager names to an array of manager choices
          const managers = res.map((manager) => manager.manager);

          // Prompt the user for new employee details
          inquirer
            .prompt([
              {
                name: "employee",
                type: "list",
                message: "Which employee's manager would you like to update?",
                choices: employees,
              },
              {
                name: "manager",
                type: "list",
                message: "Who is the employee's new manager?",
                choices: managers,
              },
            ])
            .then((answer) => {
              // Create a temporary table to hold the employee IDs and full names
              connection.query(
                `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_employee
                    SELECT id, CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
                    FROM employee`,
                function (err, res) {
                  if (err) throw err;
                  // Update the employee's manager ID
                  connection.query(
                    `UPDATE employee
                            SET manager_id = (SELECT id FROM temp_employee WHERE full_name = ?)
                            WHERE CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) = ?`,
                    [answer.manager, answer.employee],
                    function (err, res) {
                      if (err) throw err;
                      console.log(
                        colors.brightGreen("Employee manager updated!")
                      );
                      // Drop the temporary table
                      connection.query(
                        `DROP TEMPORARY TABLE temp_employee`,
                        function (err, res) {
                          if (err) throw err;
                          start();
                        }
                      );
                    }
                  );
                }
              );
            });
        }
      );
    }
  );
}
```

### View Department Budget
This function prompts the user to select a department and then queries the database to calculate and display the total utilized budget of that department, which is calculated as the sum of all salaries of employees who belong to that department.
```js
function viewBudget() {
  // Query departments to get a list of available departments
  connection.query(`SELECT name FROM department`, function (err, res) {
    if (err) throw err;

    // Map the department names to an array of department choices
    const departments = res.map((department) => department.name);

    // Prompt the user for the department to view the budget of
    inquirer
      .prompt([
        {
          name: "department",
          type: "list",
          message: "Which department's budget would you like to view?",
          choices: departments,
        },
      ])
      .then((answer) => {
        // Query the total utilized budget of the department
        connection.query(
          `SELECT SUM(salary) AS budget FROM role
                    INNER JOIN employee ON employee.role_id = role.id
                    INNER JOIN department ON role.department_id = department.id
                    WHERE department.name = ?`,
          [answer.department],
          function (err, res) {
            if (err) throw err;
            // Log the total utilized budget of the department
            console.table(res);
            start();
          }
        );
      });
  });
}
